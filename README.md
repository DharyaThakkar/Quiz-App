# Quiz-App
This is a mini-project, Quiz-app created by me using HTML5,CSS(BOOTSTRAP) & JAVASCRIPT.I have also added the functionalities of displaying the result.
For displaying the result I have used some animations to make it feel realistic using some pre-built function of Window object.
I have used the setInterval() method and had stopped it using the clearInterval() method, when the actual score of the user reaches.
Both these method setInterval() and clearInterval() are present inside the Window Object(global Object).
